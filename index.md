We are a research group, within the [National MRI Laboratory (LANIREM)](http://www.lanirem.inb.unam.mx/), at the [Institute of Neurobiology](http://inb.unam.mx/index.html), [National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)](https://www.unam.mx/) in Querétaro, Mexico. 

Our research focuses on finding neuroimaging biomarkers in substance addiction and other neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as researching new treatments. 

Our formal lines of research are:

* Frontostriatal system in substance use and addiction, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
* Identification of neuroimaging biomarkers in humans and animal models.
* Action mechanisms and possible uses of neuromodulation methods.
